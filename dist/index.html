          <p class="info">
            Programming is, according to me, the perfect mix between problem
            solving and artistic creativity. This makes it, for a person such as
            myself always on the border between the aesthetician and the
            analyst, a perfect activity. Ever since I with the help of Python
            tried (sometimes successfully) to solve Project Euler problems and
            constructing simple platformers with my cousins in Java, coding has
            been one of my great interests. To me the specific programming
            language is merely a tool serving an inspiring idea, which has
            resulted in both a broad insight in different programming paradigms
            and a capability to rather quickly get a hang of new code bases.<br />
            Other than programming, my interests are literature and philosophy,
            mathematics, painting and fiddling with the 3D animation software
            Blender. I am twenty-three years old and currently based in
            Stockholm, Sweden. <br />
            My stengths mainly consists of front-end/fullstack development with
            the React framework, Sass and Node.js, as well as a variety of
            applications with Python. I also have a fair amount of experience
            working with Java and, thanks to my university studies, C# and SQL.
            Other skills consists of the 3D animation software Blender and
            Photoshop.
